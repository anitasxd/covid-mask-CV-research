# Computer Vision Research Project - Covid Mask Wearing Detection

This research project trains a computer vision model, YOLO: real-time object detection, to recognize diverse mask wearing. Our team optimized hyperparameters and minized loss to achieve a model accuracy of 0.88 for non-mask wearers and 0.99 for mask wearers.

The project is created by Anita Shen, Erica Zhu, Jasmine Wang, Tony Yu, Aditya Krishnan, and Ryusuke Suehiro
